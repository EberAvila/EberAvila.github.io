Abstract: We propose two distributed controller solutions to leader-followers consensus problem on inertial multiagent systems that guarantee connectivity preservation based on articial potential functions. On the frst one, we consider a virtual leader which has a fixed, or constant velocity, with consensus defned as a position reference to be tracked. On the second, leader's velocity is time-varying. In both cases, we consider that only a subset of agents have access to leader's state information. Effectiveness of proposed controllers is illustrated with numerical simulations.
