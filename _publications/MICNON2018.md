excerpt: 'We propose two distributed controller solutions to the leader-followers consensus problem on inertial multiagent systems with guarantee connectivity preservation based on artificial potential functions. On the first one, we consider a virtual leader with constant velocity, in this case consensus is defined as a position reference to be tracked. On the second, the leader’s velocity is time-varying. In both cases, we consider that only a subset of agents have access to leader’s state information. Effectiveness of proposed controllers is illustrated with numerical simulations.'

Abstract: We propose two distributed controller solutions to the leader-followers consensus problem on inertial multiagent systems with guarantee connectivity preservation based on artificial potential functions. On the first one, we consider a virtual leader with constant velocity, in this case consensus is defined as a position reference to be tracked. On the second, the leader’s velocity is time-varying. In both cases, we consider that only a subset of agents have access to leader’s state information. Effectiveness of proposed controllers is illustrated with numerical simulations.
