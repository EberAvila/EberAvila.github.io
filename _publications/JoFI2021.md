title: "Flocking motion in swarms with limited sensing radius and heterogeneous input constraints"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/JoFI2021
excerpt: 'Motivated by the existing work on homogeneous and heterogeneous swarms of agents, we study the flocking motion problem for a group of agents with limited communication/sensing radius and heterogeneous input constraints. We propose distributed controllers to achieve both leaderless and leader-followers flocking motion. Our designs preserve network connections and satisfy individual control effort bounds. The designed controllers allow for agents with higher capabilities to compensate for the control effort that less capable neighbors cannot fulfill.'

Highlights: Motivated by the existing work on homogeneous and heterogeneous swarms of agents, we study the flocking motion problem for a group of agents with limited communication/sensing radius and heterogeneous input constraints. We propose distributed controllers to achieve both leaderless and leader-followers flocking motion. Our designs preserve network connections and satisfy individual control effort bounds. The designed controllers allow for agents with higher capabilities to compensate for the control effort that less capable neighbors cannot fulfill.
