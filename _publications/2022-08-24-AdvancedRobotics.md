excerpt: 'Motivated by the existing work on homogeneous and heterogeneous swarms of agents, we study the flocking motion problem for a group of agents with limited communication/sensing radius and heterogeneous input constraints. We propose distributed controllers to achieve both leaderless and leader-followers flocking motion. Our designs preserve network connections, satisfy individual control effort bounds and avoid nearby obstacles. The designed controllers allow for agents with higher capabilities to compensate for the control effort that less capable neighbors cannot fulfill.'

Abstract: This paper addresses the leaderless and leader-followers flocking motion problems of multi-agent systems in a workspace with obstacles. We consider inertial agents with equally limited communica- tion radius and heterogeneous input constraints. Using the notion of proximity graphs, we provide distributed controllers to induce the desired flocking behaviour. Unlike previous results, our con- troller designs do not require predicted states or a target determination scheme and allow edge deletions. Also, by taking advantage of the group’s heterogeneity, our controllers allow agents with less restrictive input constraints to compensate for the control effort that their less capa- ble neighbours cannot provide. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposals through numerical simulations.
