excerpt: 'Motivated by the existing work on homogeneous and heterogeneous swarms of agents, we study the flocking motion problem for a group of agents with limited communication/sensing radius and heterogeneous input constraints. We propose distributed controllers to achieve both leaderless and leader-followers flocking motion. Our designs preserve network connections and satisfy individual control effort bounds. The designed controllers allow for agents with higher capabilities to compensate for the control effort that less capable neighbors cannot fulfill.'

Abstract: This paper addresses the flocking motion problem for swarms of agents with two restrictions: limited communication/detection ranges and different input constraints. In this problem, the distance between pairs of agents determines if a communication/detection link exists among them, while each agent has a different control action bound. We use the notion of proximity graph to model communication/detection between agents and provide distributed controllers designed for leaderless and leader-followers flocking motion scenarios. Our proposed designs preserve the connectivity of the proximity graph while the control effort satisfies the bound of each particular agent. Unlike previous results, our protocols take advantage of the group’s input heterogeneity to use agents with a greater capacity to compensate for neighbors that are less capable of meeting the group’s requirements. Additionally, our designs are based only on local state errors and are robust to non-modeled edge failures. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposal, we use numerical simulations of different flocking scenarios.
