# About Me
I received the B.S. degree in engineering from the Tecnológico Superior de San Luis Potosí, Capital, in 2007; And the M.S. and PhD degree in control and dynamic systems from the Instituto Potosino de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, A.C. in 2014 and 2022, respectively.

My research lies in the intersection of control systems and graph theory. I am specially interest on the design of distributed controllers to induce collective behaviours on multi-agent systems and their implementation on multi-robot systems.

# Research Interests
- Nonlinear control
- Graph theory
  - State-dependent graphs
