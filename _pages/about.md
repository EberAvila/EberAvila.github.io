# About Me
I received a B.S. degree in engineering from the Instituto Tecnológico Superior de San Luis Potosí, Capital, San Luis Potosí, México, in 2007; And the M.S. and PhD degree in control and dynamic systems from the Instituto Potosino de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, A.C., San Luis Potosí, México, in 2014 and 2022, respectively.

My research lies in the intersection of control systems and graph theory. I am especially interested in the distributed controller design to induce collective behaviours in multi-agent systems and their implementation in multi-robot systems.
