# About Me
I am a phd student within the Control and Dynamic Systems Department (DCS) at Instituto Potosino de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (IPICYT) adviced by Dr. Juan Gonzalo Barajas Ramírez, head of the Complex Networks Lab (LRC).

My research lies in the intersection of control systems and graph theory. I am specially interest on the design of distributed controllers to induce collective behaviours on multi-agent systems and their implementation on multi-robot systems.

# Research Interests
- Nonlinear control
- Graph theory
  - State-dependent graphs
  - Distributed connectivity estimation
- Distributed control of multi-agent systems
  - Flocking motion
  - Consensus
  - Synchornization
