About me
======
I am a phd student at Instituto Potosino de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (IPICYT) adviced by Dr. Juan Gonzalo Barajas Ramírez within the complex networks lab.

My research lies in the intersection of control systems and graph theory. I am specially interest on the design of distributed controllers to induce collective behaviours on multi-agent systems and their implementation on multi-robot systems.

Research Interests
======
* Nonlinear control
* Graph theory
  * State-dependent graphs
  * Distributed connectivity estimation
* Distributed control of multi-agent systems
  * Flocking motion
  * Consensus
  * Synchornization

News
======
* There are no news.
